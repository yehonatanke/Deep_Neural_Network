# Deep neural network to distinguish cat images from non-cat images.
# There going to be two different models:
# - A 2-layer neural network.
# - An L-layer deep neural network.
# Evaluates the models' performance and explores diverse 𝐿 values to enhance the results.

# General Methodology:
# 1. Initialize parameters / Define hyperparameters
# 2. Loop for num_iterations:
#   - a. Forward propagation.
#   - b. Compute cost function.
#   - c. Backward propagation.
#   - d. Update parameters (using parameters, and grads from backprop).
# 3. Use trained parameters to predict labels.

# 2-layer neural network:
# The model can be summarized as: INPUT -> LINEAR -> RELU -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID -> OUTPUT.
# Detailed Architecture:
# - The input is a (64,64,3) image that is flattened to a vector of size (12288,1).
# - The corresponding vector: [𝑥0,𝑥1,...,𝑥12287]𝑇 is then multiplied by the weight matrix 𝑊[1] of size (𝑛[1],12288).
# - Then, add a bias term and take its relu to get the following vector: [𝑎[1]0,𝑎[1]1,...,𝑎[1]𝑛[1]−1]𝑇 .
# - Multiply the resulting vector by 𝑊[2] and add the intercept (bias).
# - Finally, take the sigmoid of the result. If it's greater than 0.5, classify it as a cat.

# L-layer neural network:
# The model can be summarized as: [LINEAR -> RELU] × (L-1) -> LINEAR -> SIGMOID
# Detailed Architecture:
# - The input is a (64,64,3) image that is flattened to a vector of size (12288,1).
# - The corresponding vector: [𝑥0,𝑥1,...,𝑥12287]𝑇 is then multiplied by the weight matrix 𝑊[1]
#   Then add the intercept 𝑏[1]. The result is called the linear unit.
# - Next, the relu of the linear unit. This process could be repeated several times for each (𝑊[𝑙],𝑏[𝑙]) depending on
#   the model architecture.
# - Finally, the sigmoid of the final linear unit. If it is greater than 0.5, it'd classify as a cat.

# Explanation:
# - The first call (predictions_train) evaluates how well the model performs on the data it was trained on.
# This gives an indication of how well the model has learned from the training dataset.
# - The second call (predictions_test) evaluates the model's performance on new, unseen data (the testing dataset).
# This provides insights into how well the model generalizes to examples it has not seen during training.
# The testing dataset serves as a proxy for how the model might perform on new, real-world data.

# A few types of images the model tends to do poorly on include:
# - Cat body in an unusual position
# - Cat appears against a background of a similar color
# - Unusual cat color and species
# - Camera Angle
# - Brightness of the picture
# - Scale variation (the cat is very large or small in image)
